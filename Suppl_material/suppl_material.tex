\subsection*{Linear models for spatial and temporal seed limitation}
\label{sec:model-select-aver}

In this section we report details of the statistical models used to
describe spatial seed limitation (\emph{SSL}, equation 1 in Methods in
the main paper) and temporal seed limitation (\emph{TSL}, equation
2). We also provide the coefficients of the selected models
($\Delta \mathrm{AICc} \leq 2$), $\mathrm{AICc}$ values for each model and the
coefficients for the average model, obtained from the selected models.


Generalized linear mixed models (glmm) were used to evaluate which
traits were more related to the spatial and/or temporal seed
limitation of the species sampled. As the response variables (SSL and
TSL) are the number of unoccupied traps or months out of a total, a
binomial glmm with the logit link function was used
\cite{bolker2009,dobson2018}. Through the inclusion of random factors,
a mixed model approach allows accounting for hierarchical
relationships and non-independent factors adequately
\cite{bolker2009,Zuur2009book}.  In these models, species identity was
included as a random factor, as there were three values for each
species (i.e., one for each year), and it was expected that temporal
or spatial limitation of the same species was non-independent among
years.

Fixed factors used in the linear models were the following:
\begin{description}
\item[Log seed mass]: logarithm dry seed mass average of each plant
  species. Dry seed mass average were calculated from at least 10
  seeds randomly picked among those collected in the traps (for most
  abundant species, 50 seeds were used);
\item[Adult maximum height]: maximum tree height recorded in the study
  site \cite{pansonato2018}.
\item[Frequency of adults]: proportion of the 40 plots in which a tree
  species was observed in the study site inventory
  \cite{pansonato2018}.
\end{description}


Frequency of adult trees was included to discount the effect of the
spatial distribution of adult individuals on seed limitation. As seed
shadow is strongly concentrated below or nearby adult trees
\cite{flores2013introduced,larios2018}, the presence of a species in a
given seed trap is more probable where an adult individual is present
in the plot. Hence, for spatial seed limitation it would be expected
that a species with a wide spatial distribution of adult individuals
would show low spatial seed limitation. The relationship between
frequency of adult trees and temporal seed limitation is not as
direct. However, species with a broad spatial distribution might be
subjected to more heterogeneous environmental
conditions. Consequently, individuals under distinct conditions (for
example, canopy gaps/closed canopy, flooding/non-flooding) could
promote intraspecific asynchrony among adult individuals of a species
and extend its reproductive period. Hence, a broad spatial
distribution could be related to low temporal seed limitation. Seeds
were also previously classified into two dispersal syndrome
categories, zoochorous and non-zoochorous. However, only four species
(from 31 at total) had non-zoochorous seeds. As this strongly
unbalanced distribution precludes a robust analysis of its effects on
seed limitation, this trait was not used in the analyses.

For each response variable — spatial seed limitation (SSL) or temporal
seed limitation (TSL) — a full glmm model was fit with the glmer
function from the lme4 package \cite{lme4}. In the full model, species
identity was included as a random factor, and all other variables and
their two-way interactions were included as fixed factors. Continuous
fixed factors were standardized by computing z-score values to ease
model convergence \cite{Zuur2009book} and to allow for a direct
comparison of their effects. By using the \emph{dredge} function from
the MuMIn package \cite{MuMIn}, all possible combinations of fixed
factors and two-way interactions were fit and compared. Model
selection was performed using Akaike information criteria (with
correction for small samples) that were calculated with the
\emph{AICc} function from the bbmle package \cite{bbmle}. All models
with $\mathrm{AICc} \leq 2.0$ were considered equally plausible
\cite{Burnham2002}. When multiple models were selected, the average
model was calculated \cite{Burnham2002} using the \emph{model.avg}
function from the MuMIn package \cite{MuMIn} to estimate the effect of
each fixed factor and confidence intervals. Predicted values of the
averaged model were estimated as the average of the fitted values of
each selected model, weighted by their Akaike evidence
weights. $\mathrm{Pseudo-}R^2$ \cite{nakagawa2017} values were
calculated for each selected model using the \emph{r.squaredGLMM}
function from the MuMIn package.

Additionally, generalized linear models (glm) were fitted considering
the total pooled for the 36 months, for both SSL and TSL. For these
analyses, a mixed model was not required because they did not have
repeated values for each species. The procedures of model expansion
using the function \emph{dredge} and model selection were performed in
the same way as described above for the glmm models, but applying
quasi-binomial fitting and quasi-AIC for the model selection were
needed to correct overdispersion of the binomial fits
\cite{Zuur2009book}.

Some species/morphotypes were excluded from the correlation analysis
and from the trait relationships analysis: i) allochthonous seeds
(i.e., seeds of species not recorded as adult trees within the forest
fragment); ii) morphotypes identified only to the genus level, and
with two or more species of this genus among the adults of the forest
site; and iii) species with less than 5 seeds sampled along the three
years, which was stated as a minimum to obtain reliable estimates of
seed limitation.

Tables~\ref{tab:SSL} to \ref{tab:TSL_glm} report the coefficients of
the selected models, $\mathrm{(Q)AICc}$ values for each model and the
coefficients for the average model, obtained from the selected
models. All the fixed-effect variables were standardized as z-values,
to ease convergence of the mixed-effect models, and also to allow
comparison of the coefficients for each effect. We thus refer the
coefficients as ``standardized coefficients''.

Figures~\ref{fig:SSL_glm} and \ref{fig:TSL_glm} show the observed
values of pooled SSL and TSL respectively, and the
predicted values by the fitted generalized linear models.

\section*{Circular statistics of temporal distribution of seeds}
\label{sec:circ-stat-temp}

The mean number of seed species in each month for the three years was
used to calculate a mean distribution vector (r), represented by the
red line in Fig.~\ref{fig:circular}. Small vectors, like the one
seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:circular}, indicate low temporal synchrony and
high uniformity among the months. The calculated value of the mean
distribution vectors was $r=0.0475$, and the Rayleigh Test of
Uniformity (Z) returned a p-value of $p=0.709$, and thus the null
hypothesis of uniform distribution over months can not be
rejected. This figure, the \emph{r} calculation, and the Rayleigh test
were performed with the circular R package \cite{circular}.
